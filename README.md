# Lebron Chatbot 🏀

Ever wanted to speak to my GOAT ~~LePookie~~ **LeBron James**? Well, here's your chance!

Lebron Chatbot is a chatbot that allows you to simulate speaking to LeBron James, it will be as if he was right here speaking to you _(minus the championships)_.

Imagine LeBron Saying this right in your face:

> OH YEA, that's my favourite saying

Yep, that's what this app plans to do.

## Features

* Get motivational responses like _"That's a W!"_ and _"Stay locked in!"_
* Tasks get "traded away" instead of deleted (very professional)
* Error messages call your mistakes "bricks" 🧱
* Persistent storage so LeBron remembers your tasks

## Supported Commands

1. `todo` - For when you need to do something
1. `deadline` - For when you need to do something _before the buzzer_
1. `event` - For scheduling your NBA watch parties
1. `list` - See all your tasks (the "game plan")
1. `mark` / `unmark` - Toggle task completion
1. `delete` - Trade away tasks you don't need
1. `find` - Search through your tasks

## Example Usage
```java
todo buy LeBron's new shoes
